# reading-habits-analysis
An attempt to analyse my reading habits online with the lens of data
This project attempts to analyse my reading habits. This is a personal data project that I have undertaken to analyse my reading consumption online
I want to understand the following things

1) What genre of articles do I read?
2) Do I find articles with more images, more engaging? 
3) What authors do I repeatedly read, if any? What are the commonalities?
4) Do recommends matter in my reading consumption ?
5) What emotion did reading that article trigger? Did it invite self reflection, happiness, sadness, nostalgia, empathy?
