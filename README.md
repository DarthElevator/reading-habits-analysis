# reading-habits-analysis
An attempt to analyse my reading habits online with the lens of data
This project attempts to analyse my reading habits. This is a personal data project that I have undertaken to analyse my reading consumption online
I want to understand the following things

1) What genre of articles do I read?
2) Do articles with more images attract me or does that not matter?
3) What authors do I repeatedly read, if any? What are the commonalities
4) Do recommends matter in my reading consumption ?
